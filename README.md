# DHTMLX React Gantt Zustand Demo

This project demonstrates how to integrate the DHTMLX React Gantt component with Zustand for state management in a React application. 

The setup uses React 19+ and Vite, with full TypeScript support.

## Features:

- Powerful Gantt chart UI for project planning and task management.

- Task and link creation, update, and deletion managed through Zustand store actions.

- React component driven approach with props controlling Gantt configuration.

- Seamless Zustand integration for lightweight and simple state management.

- Support for zoom levels (day, month, year), undo/redo operations, and drag-and-drop functionality.

- Interactive toolbar with Material-UI components for enhanced user experience.

- Strong TypeScript support for type-safe usage.
